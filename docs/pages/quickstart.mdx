# Quickstart

## Setup your editor

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) you should install the [rspc extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oscartbeaumont.rspc-vscode) for useful code shortcuts.

## CLI

Coming soon...

## Manual setup

Get rspc up and running in your own project.

<Steps>

### Create new project (optional)

If you haven't got a Rust project already setup, create a new one using the following command.

```bash
cargo new <project-name>
cd <project-name>
cargo add tokio --features full # rpsc requires an async runtime
```

### Install rspc

`rspc` is distributed through a Rust crate hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rspc). Add it to your project using the following command:

```bash
cargo add rspc
```

This command will not exist if your running a Rust version earlier than `1.62.0`, please upgrade your Rust version if this is the case.

### Create a router

Go into `src/main.rs` and add the following code:

```rs copy filename="src/main.rs"
use rspc::alpha::Rspc;

const R: Rspc<()> = Rspc::new();

fn router() -> crate::Router<()> {
    R.router()
        // TODO: Set ts export path using config
        .procedure("version", R.query(|ctx, _: ()| env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")))
        .compat()
}


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let router = router();

    // TODO: Mount an integration to expose your API
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // It is highly recommended to unit test your rspc router by creating it
    // This will ensure it doesn't have any issues and also export updated Typescript types.

    #[test]
    fn test_rspc_router() {
        super::router();
    }
}
```

### Exposing your router

Now that you have a router your probably wondering how you access it from your frontend. This is done through an rspc integration. I would recommend starting with [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), by following [this](/integrations/axum).

### Usage on the frontend

Install the frontend package using the following command:

<Interpolate>

```bash
pnpm install @rspc/client @rspc/react
```

</Interpolate>

<IfFramework framework="react">

```tsx copy filename="src/MyComponent.tsx"
console.log("React");

// TODO: Finish this example
```

</IfFramework>

<IfFramework framework="solid">

```tsx copy filename="src/MyComponent.tsx"
console.log("Solid");

// TODO: Finish this example
```

</IfFramework>

</Steps>

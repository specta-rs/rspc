# rspc

rspc is a typesafe router allowing you to build end-to-end type safe APIs.

It lets you define your backend logic in a Rust function and use the Typescript client to call it.

Your rspc router is transport agnostic which means you can serve it from any HTTP server of your choice such as [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) or even from [Tauri](https://tauri.app).

## Features

- ✅ **Typesafety** - allows your team to move faster and **eliminate** a whole class of common bugs
- ✅ **Developer experience** - you **define a function** in Rust and can **call it from the frontend** with no extra effort
- ✅ **Minimal runtime** - small runtime footprint so your can get the **full potential of Rust's speed**
